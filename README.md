# Imaging Around Corners Project

# Abstract

Reconstructing an occluded image has many advantages. It could have applications in medicine, safety, security, etc.  In many scenarios using a mirror would be sufficient. This project demonstrates the use of a diffuse wall as a mirror using image processing methods.
The area of video filming is under constant development and cameras are becoming faster and faster. This development enabled the formation of a new type of images, transient images, in which the transport of light in space can be observed and analyzed.
Using Time of Flight (TOF), it is possible to measure distances by transmitting laser beams and has been in common use for several years now. Recently, a method has been developed for exploiting this in order to create transient images. As part of Project A in the Vision and Image Science Laboratory (VISL) at the Technion, an analysis of a hidden scene was performed using a transient image by a simulation program and Matlab.
